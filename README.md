### Hi, I'm Sonia Atsen 👋

I’m an software developer, writer and public speaker. I'm a frontend developer with [Wix](wix.com) and also the teamlead of [Jos Tech Girls](jostechgirls.com). I am an avid advocate for diversity and intersectionality in technology and accessibility in web development. I am also a storyteller, so for me, its not the number of codes i have written, but the way i can prefectly tell my story.

- 📱  I’m currently working on a site to teach kids how to code using poetry..
- 🤓 I’m currently learning WORDPRESS.
- 💬  Ask me about WEB DEVELOPMENT, REACT and TENSORFLOW.
